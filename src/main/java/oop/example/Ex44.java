        /*Pulling data from a file into a complex data structure makes parsing much simpler.
        Many programming languages support the JSON format, a popular way of representing data.
        Create a program that takes a product name as input and retrieves the current price
        and quantity for that product. The product data is in a data file in the JSON format
        and looks like this:
            {
                "products" : [
                    {"name": "Widget", "price": 25.00, "quantity": 5 },
                    {"name": "Thing", "price": 15.00, "quantity": 5 },
                    {"name": "Doodad", "price": 5.00, "quantity": 10 }
                ]
            }
        Print out the product name, price, and quantity if the product is found. If no product
        matches the search, state that no product was found and start over.
        Example Output
            What is the product name? iPad
            Sorry, that product was not found in our inventory.
            What is the product name? Widget
            Name: Widget
            Price: $25.00
            Quantity on hand: 5
        Constraints
            The file is in the JSON format. Use a JSON parser to pull the values out of the file.
            If no record is found, prompt again.*/
