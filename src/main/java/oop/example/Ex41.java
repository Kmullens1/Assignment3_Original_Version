        /*Alphabetizing the contents of a file, or sorting its contents, is a great way
        to get comfortable manipulating a file in your program.

                Create a program that reads in the following list of names:
            Ling, Mai
            Johnson, Jim
            Zarnecki, Sabrina
            Jones, Chris
            Jones, Aaron
            Swift, Geoffrey
            Xiong, Fong

        Read this program and sort the list alphabetically. Then print the sorted list to a file that looks like thefollowing example output.
        Example Output
            Total of 7 names
            -----------------
            Ling, Mai
            Johnson, Jim
            Jones, Aaron
            Jones, Chris
            Swift, Geoffrey
            Xiong, Fong
            Zarnecki, Sabrina
        Constraint
            Don't hard-code the number of names.*/
